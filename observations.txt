Looking for bottlenecks in production speed:

-STRPL, AP, PRSHP, FLINS take longer on average than other locations

- Metal dept a bottleneck? (AP)
- Quality Contral (PRSHP)

-INSP has the longest wait with 200 days (JUANITO CASTRO)
-FLINS has the 2nd longest wait with an 169 day anomaly (due to one vendor - Precision Set Inc.)
